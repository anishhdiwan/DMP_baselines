This repository contains baseline implementations of several methods to better understand amd compare with a proposed diffusion cost functions method. 

It assumes that [IsaacGym Preview_v4](https://developer.nvidia.com/isaac-gym) and [IsaacGymEnvs](https://github.com/NVIDIA-Omniverse/IsaacGymEnvs) are both installed (preferably using the conda env). NOTE: custom envs can also be created using the isaacgym api, however, at present baselines are tested on Cartpole as defined in IsaacGymEnvs.

To run the isaacgym version of cem for cartpole execute `python cem_cartpole.py` within the rlgpu conda env.
